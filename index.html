    <body> I love reading. I have read 6th grade-level books at the age of 3 and college-level books at the age of 8. My most favorite books are the comic-like true stories of its author, Raina Telgemier, and the Harry Potter series, written by J.K. Rowling. I have even written a book myself, and it will be published soon. My love for books has grown and grown by the month, and when my birthday comes around, I make sure to get at least 1 book. I would prefer staying at home and reading my favorite stories to going to the movies or eating out. Books mentally take me to India, Russia, Hawaii, and other places you would need a lot of money for to go to in real life.</body>
